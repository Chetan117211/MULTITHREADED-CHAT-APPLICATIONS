I have successfully completed the task of developing a Java-based multithreaded client-server chat application.
During the development process, I made use of various learning resources such as YouTube tutorials, ChatGPT assistance, and discussions with my friends to clearly understand concepts related to socket programming, multithreading, and network communication in Java.
The entire coding, compilation, and execution were carried out using the Command Prompt (CMD) editor platform on Windows. After resolving initial errors and performing proper debugging, the application worked as intended â€” enabling multiple clients to connect and communicate with the server simultaneously in real-time. The expected output was achieved successfully.
